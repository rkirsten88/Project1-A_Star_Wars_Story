# Project 1 - A Star Wars Story
<p>Group 4: Abhijit Purru, Elise Eng, Jeff Chow, Rob Kirsten</p>
<p>https://github.com/rkirsten88/Project1-A_Star_Wars_Story.git</p> 
<p>Data source: “https://swapi.dev/api/”</p>

## Project Description/Outline (Proposal):
<p>Utilizing the Star Wars API from the class activities, we're going to attempt to visualize the differences in different species and character via heights and masses, and also try and build a dataframe to compare different Jedi species' attributes and determine "which Jedi" would be the best suited for a particular type of mission, based on the different planetary data.</p> 

## Research Questions:
+ Questions you found interesting and what motivated you to answer them
1. Compare planets used in the movies → how it changes over time → can we predict in future movies
  + Collect number of planets per movie
See if they can be classified & sorted as homogeneous types of planets
Create a line plot of number of planets per movie over time 
Can we use this to predict the types & number of planets in the next movie?
Compare vehicles found in the movies → how it changes over time → can we predict in future movies
Collect number of vehicles per movie
Compare vehicles used in each movie, is there a trend in types and sizes of vehicles used 
Species vs home worlds
Average height and life spans for diff species and diff characters
Compare spaceships, cargo capacity, and if Jabba the Hutt can board
How many Jabbas can we shoot into a black hole with a single spaceship?
How many Yodas make up a Jabba? (im trolling) mhm
Compare cargo capacity, average mean/sd, etc and to real life cargos https://www.swcombine.com/rules/?Cargo_Containers 
Movies to movies

## Datasets to be used:
<p>Where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions?<br>
We were interested in analyzing the Star Wars dataset found from our class activities.</p> 

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks:  
+ Import dependencies
+ Create variables
+ Data exploration/cleanup
+ Analysis/2 visuals per question (6-8 total)
+ Summary of findings
